function ptcls_out = discard_closer(ptcls_in,min_dist_angs)     
% DISCARD_CLOSER discards particles too close to another ones.
%   PTCLS_OUT = DISCARD_CLOSER(PTCLS_IN,MIN_DIST) returns a copy of
%   PTCLS_IN discarding the particles that are closer than MIN_DIST (in
%   angstroms), keeping the ones with higher CC.
