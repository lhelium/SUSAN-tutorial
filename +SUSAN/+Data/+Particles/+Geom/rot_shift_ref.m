function rot_shift_ref(ptcls_in,euZYZ,t,ref)
% ROT_SHIFT_REF Applies a rotation and a shift to a reference.
%   ROT_SHIFT_REF(PTCLS,R,T,REF) Aplies the rotation R and then the shift T
%   to the reference/class REF of the particles PTCLS_IN. R can be a 3D
%   rotation matrix or euler angles in the ZYZ format. T is a 3 elements
%   vector in angstroms.
